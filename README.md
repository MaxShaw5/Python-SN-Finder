# This is an asset management scraper for the company I work at

This script will open the asset management WebUI, search for each user's assigned assets and append them to a spreadsheet next to the user's name so we can track the monetary value associated with each user as they are onboarded or offboarded, saving our company hundreds of thousands of dollars by making it all easily trackable and calling attention to assets that may have otherwise gone under the radar
